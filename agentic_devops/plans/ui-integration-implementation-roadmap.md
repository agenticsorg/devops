## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| API integration challenges | High | Medium | Early prototyping, mock services for development |
| Performance issues with large datasets | Medium | Medium | Implement pagination, virtualization, and optimized rendering |
| Browser compatibility issues | Medium | Low | Cross-browser testing, polyfills for older browsers |
| Authentication security vulnerabilities | High | Low | Security code review, penetration testing |
| Timeline slippage | Medium | Medium | Buffer time in schedule, prioritize features for MVP |
