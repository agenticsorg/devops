CI/CD Pipeline Management Agent Example

This example demonstrates a complex multi-step workflow for managing CI/CD pipelines
using the OpenAI Agents SDK with the DevOps agent. It shows how to:

1. Create specialized agents for different parts of the CI/CD pipeline
2. Orchestrate them to work together
3. Implement guardrails for security and validation
4. Handle multi-step workflows with dependencies

Prerequisites:
- Install the OpenAI Agents SDK: pip install openai-agents
- Set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
