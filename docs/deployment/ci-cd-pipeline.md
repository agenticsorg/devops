# CI/CD Pipeline Setup

## Overview

This document outlines how to set up a CI/CD pipeline for the Agentic DevOps framework, enabling automated testing, building, and deployment.

## CI/CD Tools

We recommend using GitHub Actions for CI/CD, but you can adapt these instructions for other CI/CD systems like GitLab CI, Jenkins, or CircleCI.

## GitHub Actions Workflow

1. **Create Workflow File:**
   - Create a new workflow file in `.github/workflows` directory in your repository, e.g., `ci-cd.yaml`.

2. **Define Workflow:**
   - Define the workflow steps for testing, building, and deployment.

   ```yaml
   name: CI/CD Pipeline

   on:
     push:
       branches: [main]
     pull_request:
       branches: [main]

   jobs:
     test:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v3
         - name: Set up Python
           uses: actions/setup-python@v4
           with:
             python-version: '3.8' # or your preferred Python version
         - name: Install dependencies
           run: |
             pip install -r agentic_devops/requirements.txt
             pip install -e agentic_devops
         - name: Run tests
           run: |
             pytest agentic_devops/tests
             # Add any other test commands here

     # Example: Build and Deploy job (customize as needed)
     # deploy:
     #   needs: test
     #   runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     #   steps:
     #     - uses: actions/checkout@v3
     #     - name: Build package
     #       run: |
     #         # Add build commands here (e.g., python setup.py sdist)
     #     - name: Deploy 
     #       run: |
     #         # Add deployment commands here (e.g., deploy to PyPI, AWS Lambda, Docker Hub)
   ```

3. **Configure Secrets:**
   - Store any necessary secrets (e.g., PyPI API token, AWS credentials, Docker Hub credentials) as GitHub repository secrets.
   - Access these secrets in your workflow using `${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}`.

## CI/CD Stages

- **Test Stage:**
  - Runs automated tests to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
  - Includes unit tests, integration tests, and any other relevant tests.
- **Build Stage (Optional):**
  - Builds distributable packages (e.g., sdists, wheels, Docker images).
- **Deploy Stage (Optional):**
  - Deploys the built package to target environments (e.g., PyPI, AWS Lambda, Docker Hub, staging/production servers).

## Customization

- Customize the workflow based on your specific needs and deployment targets.
- Add more stages, steps, and configurations as required.
- Integrate with other tools and services as needed.

## Best Practices

- Keep workflows modular and reusable.
- Use environment variables and secrets for configuration and sensitive data.
- Implement proper error handling and logging in workflows.
- Monitor CI/CD pipeline performance and failures.
